                <p className="textBox">I believe that in order to truly know a person you must understand what motivates them. So, what motivates me? First and foremost, I love learning, and I am passionate about health and the human body. For this reason I chose to study Biomechanics in grad school, and I thoroughly enjoyed making computer models of the human body.<br/><br/>But... then came the question following graduation, what next? For many that answer is simple, but unfortunately for me it wasn't. Eventually I decided to take a web development bootcamp, and the rest is history. Outside of work, I have an awesome family which I love, a bunch of chickens (zero goats), and I find enjoyment as I run with my kids through the streets (and trails) of my home town.</p>
