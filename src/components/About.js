                <p className="textBox">I believe that in order to truly know a person you must understand what motivates them. So, what motivates me? First and foremost, I love learning, and I am passionate about health and the human body. For this reason I chose to study Biomechanics in grad school, and I thoroughly enjoyed making computer models of the human body.<br/><br/>But... then came the question following graduation, what next? For many that answer is simple, but unfortunately for me it wasn't. Ultimately I decided to take a web development bootcamp, in order to learn new skills and better integrate myself into the tech landscape, to continue my journey and find my niche in the world. Outside of work, I have an awesome family which I love, a bunch of chickens (zero goats), and I find enjoyment as I run with my kids through the streets (and trails) of my home town.</p>
